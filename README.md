# Code on Branch Date
# Planet Job
## Introduction
This iOS/Android app has been developed by me and a colleague in the same program as me, UW Computer Engineering.
The idea of the app is to help high school students find a job, since currently it is hard and time consuming.
Therefore we tried as much as possible to create a user friendly app and collect as much data as possible from "student type of jobs", such as entry position.
## Building the app
My colleague and I used several resources in order to be as effective as possible when developing the app. We've used trello to keep our next tasks up to date and git to be able share our code safely. I developed the frontend using React Native and some useful libraries while he developed the backend using Node.js. We used call each other on a daily basis to state what new changes we had made on the app.
## Outcome
What first had been a simple fun project turn out to be a pretty big part of us. We ended up building an app with more functionalities than we had expected. We've designed a notification system, shortlist, user registry, guest mechanism, recommendation, shortlist, search by tag and location and more. We hope to soon launch the app for the public.
